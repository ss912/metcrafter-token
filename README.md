# MyToken Smart Contract

MyToken is a simple Ethereum-based smart contract that implements a basic token system. It allows minting and burning tokens, tracks token balances for different addresses, and maintains information about the token.

## Overview

This smart contract serves as a basic example of token creation and management on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes the following functionalities:

1. **Token Information**:
   - Token Name: "apple"
   - Token Abbreviation: "apl"
   - Total Supply: 0 (initially)

2. **Token Balances**: A mapping of Ethereum addresses to their token balances is maintained.

3. **Minting Functionality**: A function to create and distribute new tokens by increasing the total supply and the balance of the sender's address.

4. **Burning Functionality**: A function to destroy tokens, reducing the total supply and the balance of the sender's address.

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

To create and distribute new tokens, you can use the `mint` function. This function takes two parameters:

1. `_address`: The Ethereum address to which the newly minted tokens will be sent.
2. `_value`: The amount of tokens to mint and send.

Example of minting 100 tokens to an address:

```solidity
function mintTokens(address recipient, uint amount) public {
    // Ensure you have sufficient permissions or conditions to call this function.
    mint(recipient, amount);
}
```

### Burning Tokens

To destroy tokens, you can use the `burn` function. This function also takes two parameters:

1. `_address`: The Ethereum address from which tokens will be burned.
2. `_value`: The amount of tokens to burn.

Before calling the `burn` function, ensure that the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the amount they want to burn. This function will deduct tokens from both the total supply and the sender's balance.

Example of burning 50 tokens from the sender's address:

```solidity
function burnTokens(uint amount) public {
    // Ensure the sender's balance is sufficient to burn the specified amount.
    burn(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
